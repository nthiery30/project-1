    <h2>Education and Personal Development</h2>
    <p>At an individual level, education helps people understand the world around them. It builds essential skills such as reading, writing, problem-solving, and communication. Through education, students learn how to analyze information, ask meaningful questions, and express their ideas clearly. These skills are valuable not only in school, but throughout life.</p>

        Education also supports personal confidence and independence. When learners gain knowledge and skills, they become more capable of pursuing their goals and adapting to new challenges. This sense of empowerment encourages lifelong learning and curiosity.
